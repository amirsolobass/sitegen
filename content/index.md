# Solo's Projects

## Welcome to my personal projects site!

Everything here was made by me. Vibe coding was kept to a minimum.
In fact, even this site was generated with a custom-built [static site generator](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-static-site-generator-python) from the course on [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev).

Have fun looking around, and feel free to [contact me!](/docs/contact/index.html)
